Unit test of a debit and credit operation for a bank account

When a debit is made, it must be checked that the balance in the account does not exceed the amount to be debited and that the amount to be debited is greater than zero. The debit subtracts money from the account.

When a credit is made, it must be checked that the amount to be credited is greater than zero. The credit adds money to the account.
